# Portfolio

Welcome to my [portfolio](https://manfredjoadev.netlify.app/)!

This is a personal project of mine, as well as a collection of my projects, resume, and contact information. I had a lot of fun building this and am extremely proud of it! I hope you can appreciate the hard work I put into this. I am a recent graduate of the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, and am looking for a full-time role as a full-stack software engineer. Please feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn if you have any questions or would like to connect!
